        "sectioneli5-8-1": "The yacaré overo is a large crocodile that lives in places with a lot of water in countries like Bolivia and Brazil. It is like a large reptile that measures more than three meters. Its skin has spots that help it hide in the green plants of its home. Additionally, it builds its nest with things it finds to protect the baby yacarés from animals that want to eat them, like some birds. It likes to eat snails and small animals like rats. However, humans are also a danger because they sometimes hunt it to use its skin. It likes to live near lakes and rivers, where it feels more comfortable. That is the yacaré overo, a very special crocodile.",

        "sectioneli5-9-5": "The text asks you to find something curious about the yacaré and either write or draw it. The images show that several stories describe that the teeth or bones of the yacaré have special powers according to the beliefs of some cultures. So you can research and share one of those interesting facts yourself.",
        "sectioneli5-10-0": "Here we do an exercise to talk about a special friend. Think of a friend and write things about him or her. For example, what is his or her name, how do their friends call them, what color is their hair and eyes, what things they like a lot, what things they don't like, who they like to play with, and what makes them happy or sad. Thus, we put all that information together to better know that friend. It's like making a little map about your special friend!",
        "sectioneli5-10-1": "Fill in the space with information about a friend of yours, such as their name, what they like to play, their hair and eye color, and what makes them happy or sad. After that, write a short paragraph describing your friend using that information. This way, you can share what your best friend is like.",
        "sectioneli5-12-0": "On Earth, there are different places that have special plants and animals. Some of these places are: - **Rainforest:** Full of trees and plants. - **Prairie:** Large green fields without many trees.  - **Temperate Forest:** Trees with leaves that change with the seasons.  - **Desert:** Very dry with sand.  - **Steppe:** Flat and dry land, with few trees.  - **Tundra:** Very cold and icy.  - **Taiga:** Cold forests with large trees. Each place is special, and maps show where they are in the world.",
        "sectioneli5-12-1": "The questions are about different places on Earth. A tropical rainforest has many trees, is hot, and rains a lot. A desert is very dry and hot with few plants. The tundra is cold and has little vegetation, while the prairie has many grasses and some flowers. A temperate forest has seasons with cold and heat, and a tropical forest is always hot and rainy. Each is different because of its climate, plants, and animals.",
        "sectioneli5-12-2": "The prairies and savannas are similar because both are large expanses filled with grass and few trees. Animals and plants live in specific places because they need certain things to survive, like climate or food. Therefore, some animals live in the savanna and others in the tundra, depending on what they need to be happy and safe.",
        "sectioneli5-13-0": "On our planet, there are different types of places called biomes. These are places like forests, deserts, or jungles. Each biome has a different climate, water, and soil with different nutrients. For example, in the desert there is not much water, so the plants and animals that live there are adapted and do not need much. Each group of plants and animals that lives in a place forms an ecosystem. These ecosystems can be very far apart, but they can be similar, like the jungles in Africa, South America, and Asia. The images show examples of different biomes and how they look.",
        "sectioneli5-13-1": "Humans live in biomes, which are natural places like forests and deserts. To live and do things like produce food and build houses, people change nature. They do things like plant fruits, build bridges and roads. It's important to make these changes carefully so that nature is not damaged too much, because sometimes we make changes that we cannot fix.",
        "sectioneli5-13-2": "Biomes are large natural areas like forests or deserts. The climate and terrain make these biomes different. For example, mountains can divide winds: one side can be wet and the other dry. Also, the height of the mountains changes how the biomes are, forming different layers of plants and animals at different levels.",
        "sectioneli5-14-0": "When we cut down many trees, hunt too many animals, or extract many things from the earth to obtain resources like oil, we are harming the planet. Therefore, experts say that we should do these things in a way that does not harm our home or the future of the next generations. This is called \"sustainable development,\" which means using what we need now, but ensuring that our grandchildren also have what they need.",
        "sectioneli5-14-1": "The jungles, or tropical rainforests, are places where it is very hot and it rains a lot throughout the year. You can find them in South America, Central America, Africa, Asia, and Australia. The Amazon is the largest rainforest, it is truly enormous and extends over 7,000,000 square kilometers! In the rainforests, there are many types of plants and animals. There are very tall trees that form a canopy, and underneath there are vines, shrubs, and much more. Monkeys, birds, insects, and many other animals live in the rainforests. When people cut down trees to use the wood or search for minerals, many different plants and animals can be lost. This is called deforestation and it's bad for our planet because it causes animals to disappear, affects the climate, and damages the soil.",
        "sectioneli5-15-0": "Forests are places with many trees, mainly in climates where it is cold or there are temperate seasons, like in the image of green trees with mountains. In these forests, the trees are quite spaced apart and seem to take a break in winter. Here, it is harder to find different types of plants and animals than in the jungle.  There are two types of trees in forests: those that lose their leaves and others that are always green, called conifers. The animals that live here are usually hunters, like foxes and wolves. In very cold forests, such as the taiga in Canada and Siberia, animals that withstand the cold, such as bears and lynxes, live here, and some even sleep all winter!",
        "sectioneli5-15-1": "The prairies are large fields of green grass that have almost no trees. They are cool and humid places, perfect for planting things like grains and for raising animals like cows. The image shows a prairie in Uruguay, where everything looks very green and open.",
        "sectioneli5-16-0": "In this activity, we are learning how to identify the main theme of a text. Think of titles as the names of the parts of the book you just read about ‘The Biomes’. You need to see what words are repeated a lot, that tells you what it’s all about. And if you see the funny crocodile with the pencil, he's here to help you! For example, when you see subtitles like 'Jungles', that’s a clue for the theme.",
        "sectioneli5-16-1": "Here you have to look at the title and subtitles of a text to discover what it is about. The word you see the most in the title and subtitles tells you what the main topic is. So, in the end, you can say what the text is about in a simple sentence.",
        "sectioneli5-16-2": "Biomes are like different neighborhoods in nature, and the climate and mountains are very important for knowing what they look like. Imagine that the wind carries water from the ocean and makes rain on one side of the mountain, but the other side remains dry. Moreover, when we go up a mountain, the biomes change as if they were floors of a building, and that makes it special! The funny crocodile can help us remember that learning about nature is fun.",
        "sectioneli5-16-3": "This exercise teaches how to find what a text is about. Look for a sentence that summarizes the whole text and write it down. Normally, explanatory texts start with a sentence that states what will be discussed. That sentence is like a summary of the main topic.",
        "sectioneli5-17-0": "The resources at school help us study better. For example, the notebook 'My Notes' is where we write important things that we need to remember. The blue folder can be used to store papers and loose sheets. The 'Dictionary' helps us know what words mean and how they are spelled. The small computer is for searching for information on the internet and learning faster. Finally, the 'Science' book teaches us about plants, animals, and the world around us. Everything is organized into groups like science and mathematics so that we can easily find what we need.",
        "sectioneli5-17-1": "Imagine that you are in a library and you need to find books on different topics. You have a bookshelf with sections such as language, social sciences, natural sciences, mathematics, and art.   - 'Digital Image' goes in Visual Arts.  - 'Homonyms' goes in Language and Literature.  - 'Rivers of Uruguay' goes in Social Sciences.  - 'Biomes' and 'The Digestive System' go in Natural Sciences.  - 'Types of Polygons' goes in Mathematics.  - 'The Eastern Revolution' and 'Myths and Legends' go in Social Sciences. This way, you can find the right book more easily when studying.",
        "sectioneli5-17-2": "Let's classify subjects into two types: natural sciences and social sciences.  - Natural sciences: Here we study nature and how the world works. This includes things like **chemistry** (test tubes), **astronomy** (the telescope), **biology** (DNA), **physics** (E=mc²), and **geology** (rocks). - Social sciences: Here we learn about people and their societies. This includes **geography** (the globe) and **history** (the book with an hourglass). In this way, we can see how to group different studies to understand more about the world and people.",
        "sectioneli5-18-0": "In this activity, we are shown two images about nature. The first image has arrows showing how air and climate affect a mountain, with rain on one side and dry air on the other. The second image shows a landscape with a mountain and parts like the summit and the valley. We must think about the relationship between these things, such as why it rains more on one side of the mountain and not on the other.",
        "sectioneli5-18-1": "Look at the images and think about which side is wetter and which is drier. The 'wet slope' is where there is a lot of rain and the trees look green and fresh. The 'arid slope' is where it doesn't rain much and there are desert plants, like cacti. Try to decide where each would go.",

Write down why you chose one image and why you did not choose the other. This helps practice how to explain your ideas and decisions.",
        "sectioneli5-19-0": "Let's see what questions we can answer after reading about 'The Biomes'. Think of questions like: where are jungles? or what types of biomes are there in Uruguay? It's a bit like searching for clues in a story to find the right answers. If you don't understand, it's okay to read again. This will help you learn more about nature and the world around us.",
        "sectioneli5-19-1": "Think of three questions that you can answer after reading about 'Types of Biomes'. Try to make the questions related to what you have learned. Then, share your questions with your friends in class. This will help you to understand better and learn from what others have also discovered.",
        "sectioneli5-19-2": "This exercise teaches us to work with our friends. You have to write two questions that your friends have asked and then write the answers. The idea is to practice and better understand what we are learning. Sometimes, it is good to reread something to find the correct answer.",
        "sectioneli5-20-0": "We are learning about biomes, which are places in nature like jungles, forests, and prairies. Each has its climate, plants, animals, and activities that people can do there. In the task, you need to read and write the information about each biome in a chart. For example, forests have \"temperate climates.\" Additionally, a small drawing encourages us to complete the chart with the details we find.",
        "sectioneli5-20-1": "In this exercise, we have to think about what makes different natural places unique, called biomes. To do this, we are going to use items from a list such as temperature, soil type, whether there are mountains, trees, rain, and more. Imagine that these are pieces of a puzzle that together describe what a place in nature is like. In this way, we learn what makes each biome special, like a forest or a prairie.",
        "sectioneli5-21-0": "The prairies in Uruguay are large fields of grass, like a massive area for cows and horses to graze. The plants that grow there include grasses, shrubs, and legumes, like small plants called chircas. These prairies cover almost all of Uruguay (80%), which means that many people work in agricultural activities, such as taking care of cows and growing plants, which are very important for the country. The climate of the prairies is mild, with temperatures around 15 degrees Celsius, and it rains enough, between 500 and 1000 millimeters a year. This makes the plants grow well, like a very large outdoor garden.",
        "sectioneli5-21-1": "We are learning about prairies and what they are like. Prairies are places where there is a lot of grass but few trees. They have a temperate and humid climate, which means it is neither too hot nor too cold and it rains quite a bit. These places are perfect for planting things like cereals and raising cows. We need to combine this new information with what we already know to better understand how prairies work.",
        "sectioneli5-21-2": "You are going to write a text about the prairies in Uruguay using three pieces of information. Each one tells you something important: one about plants like grasses and shrubs, another about how much agriculture and ranching is done in Uruguay, and another about the climate, which is temperate and humid. You are going to put all that together and check that you use periods and commas well so that the text is nice and complete.",
        "sectioneli5-21-3": "In Uruguay, there are fields called prairies. In the prairies, plants such as grasses and shrubs grow. Activities like agriculture and livestock farming are very important because these prairies occupy a lot of space in the country. The climate is mild and humid, being perfect for these important plants to grow. Remember to write a text using this information about the prairies of Uruguay, and make sure to use punctuation correctly! And look, the little drawing of a crocodile with a pencil encourages you to write, how fun!",

It is a large natural area like a jungle or a desert. By completing the words, we will learn more about what makes each biome special, like the plants and animals that live there. Think about which words fit to better understand these natural areas!",
        "sectioneli5-22-1": "Let's explain some words. When we talk about 'deciduous foliage', it means that the leaves of trees and shrubs fall during the cold weather. 'Predators' are animals that hunt other animals to live. And when we talk about 'oilseeds', they are plants that can be used to make oil, such as sunflowers or soybeans.",
        "sectioneli5-23-0": "People live in natural places called biomes. To get what they need, such as food or houses, they change these places. This can be good or bad for nature. For example, building structures or planting crops modifies the environment. It is important to understand that all parts of the Earth have been changed in some way by people. Therefore, we must learn to take care of the environment while we live in it.",
        "sectioneli5-23-1": "Let's talk about how some of the things we do can harm our planet. One of these things is deforestation, which is when we cut down many trees. This can cause two big problems: soil loss, which means that the land becomes bad for planting, and the loss of biodiversity, which means that some plants and animals can disappear. It is important to know these consequences to better care for the Earth.",
        "sectioneli5-24-0": "Let's talk about two places called biomes: the savanna and the desert. - In the savanna, the climate is tropical. There is a rainy season and a dry one. Animals such as the jaguar and the deer live there. People there engage in agriculture and take care of animals like cows. - In the desert, there is very little water, it is very hot, and the temperature can change. There are special plants called xerophytes, such as cacti, that live with little water. People also look for minerals here. Cacti are xerophytic plants; this means they can live with very little water.",
        "sectioneli5-24-1": "Biomes are like big houses for many animals and plants. In America, there are two interesting biomes: the savanna and the desert. The **savanna** is like a warm place with two types of climate: one dry and one rainy. Animals like jaguars and deer live here. In the savanna, people practice agriculture and raise animals. On the other hand, the **desert** is very dry and hot. Desert plants, called **xerophytes**, are special plants that can live without much water, like cacti. In the desert, valuable things in the ground, like minerals, are sought. It's amazing how nature has its tricks to survive!",
        "sectioneli5-25-0": "In this game, you must find which words go together because they have something in common. For example, \"mountain\" is related to \"slope\" because mountains have slopes. It's like matching socks: you look for the ones that make a good team together. Ask why some words like \"trees\" are related to \"forests\" and discover the correct pairs. It's a fun way to learn how things in nature are connected!",
        "sectioneli5-25-1": "In this game, we look for a word that has something in common with two given words. For example, if you have 'liquid' and 'gaseous', think about what else it could be, like 'state of water'. This is like finding the piece that connects two parts of a puzzle. In this way, we learn how words can be connected.",
        "sectioneli5-26-0": "Wangari Maathai was a biologist from Kenya who wanted to help her country by planting trees. She thought that planting trees could improve people's lives and also take care of the environment. Her project was called Green Belt, and together with many other people, they planted millions of trees in Africa. For her great work, she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize! In the photo, you can see what she looked like.",
        "sectioneli5-26-1": "Chico Mendes was a person who worked collecting rubber in Brazil. He wanted to take care of the forest because some people were cutting down too many trees without considering the damage. So he spoke with many people to stop them and protect nature. Although he was very brave, some people did not want him to speak, but his effort helped many other people around the world realize the importance of caring for the environment.",
        "sectioneli5-26-2": "Jacques-Yves Cousteau was an explorer who loved the ocean and wanted to take care of it. He traveled the world filming videos underwater to show everyone the animals and plants that live in the sea. He also organized large efforts to prevent people from throwing dangerous trash into the water. Thanks to his work and the help of many people, he managed to keep the sea clean on several occasions.",
        "sectioneli5-26-3": "In the Arctic, which is a very cold part of the world, people called Inuit live. They know a lot about the animals and plants there because they live in that place. There is a woman named Caroline Cannon who is from there. She works very hard alongside scientists to take care of the Arctic because there are some companies that want to do things that could harm it. So she tries to protect her home and the environment, like a superhero of nature.",
        "sectioneli5-27-0": "This page teaches us to think about the words we use. Look at the poster about Arbor Day. It says that planting trees is important because they help us breathe. The phrase 'you are the air that I breathe' is a catchy slogan that makes us think about protecting trees and their benefits. A slogan is like a reminder that is easy to remember and gives us an important message. Planting a tree is being part of the solution! This is how we learn about words, like verbs that say what we do, and pronouns which are small words like 'you' and 'I' that we use to talk about people.",
        "sectioneli5-27-1": "We have a poster that talks about how important trees are. Each part of the poster has a special function: 1. One part tells you how trees help the environment.  2. Another part invites you to help by planting a tree.  3. One part tells you who is conducting the campaign.  4. Finally, there is a short and catchy slogan that makes you think about taking care of trees, like 'You are the air I breathe.' It's like a game to learn what each part of the poster does.",
        "sectioneli5-27-2": "A slogan is like a short and easy-to-remember sign. It is used to remind us of something important. For example, the slogan 'You are the air that I breathe' wants us to think about the importance of planting trees, because trees help us have clean air to breathe. Thus, slogans remind us to do good things for the planet.",
        "sectioneli5-28-0": "This activity is about how we use verbs with different personal pronouns. For example, we say 'I do' when we talk about ourselves. On this sheet, you see examples where you have to put the correct verb with words like 'I', 'HE', or 'WE'. This helps to learn how to use verbs correctly in sentences.",
        "sectioneli5-28-1": "Let's complete a short story using the correct words. The words we use to say who does something, like I, you, he, we, you all, and they, are called pronouns. These change how the action or the verb is written. For example, if we say 'I take charge', 'I' is the pronoun that performs the action of taking charge. Look at the images: everyone is working together, and each character says something that helps complete the story. Thus, you can use the correct pronouns for the characters to do things like bring water or help. It's like completing a puzzle with words!",
        "sectioneli5-28-2": "When we speak, we use special words called personal pronouns to talk about ourselves or other people. If I speak about myself alone, I use 'I', but if I speak about myself and my friends, I use 'we'. If I speak to one person, I say 'you'. But if I speak to more than one person, I use 'you'. When I talk about other people, I say 'he' for a boy or 'she' for a girl. And if I talk about more than one person, I use 'they'. That's how we say who's in the conversation!",
        "sectioneli5-28-3": "In this exercise, we have to look for the forms of certain verbs that change when we talk about different people. Verbs in the infinitive like 'respirar' or 'sumar' are not changed. When we conjugate them, for example, the verb 'sumar' can become 'sumo' or 'sumamos' depending on who is doing it. Here we look for how these verbs change in the poster's table. This helps to understand how to use verbs correctly when speaking or writing in Spanish.",
        "sectioneli5-28-4": "Here's a little word game. We want to find three more verbs and say what they are called when they are not changed, in their \"infinitive form\". For example, the verb \"generan\" comes from the infinitive \"generar\". So we are looking for other verbs like this. The image of the crocodile is a friend that helps us have fun while we learn.",
        "sectioneli5-29-0": "When we see words like 'plant a tree' or 'be part of the solution', they are using verbs that tell you to do something, like planting a tree to help the environment. The images with little trees and friendly characters encourage us to participate and care for the world. It's like an invitation to do good things together!",
        "sectioneli5-29-1": "When we tell someone what they need to do, we use verbs in the imperative mood. It's like giving gentle commands, like 'plant a tree' or 'take care of the plant'. The images show how to plant a tree, using these commands: prepare the soil, make a hole, place the tree, etc. It is a step-by-step guide to help the plant grow happily.",
        "sectioneli5-29-2": "Here is a guide to planting a tree using simple instructions. Imagine you are telling someone what to do in each step: 1. Loosen the soil in a square space. 2. Dig a hole in the center and place the roots of the tree. 3. Hold the tree by the bottom and place it carefully. 4. Make sure the tree is well planted and cover it with soil. 5. Arrange the soil around the tree with your hands. 6. If the soil lacks nutrients, add fertilizer. 7. Finally, protect the tree from animals that may harm it.  We use action words, such as \"loosen\" and \"take care\", to clearly indicate what needs to be done.",

It's like a big book of nature that tells us everything about animals and plants.  2. Imagine the little bugs that live only in droplets of water and you see them with a microscope.  3. It's like the \"juice\" that is extracted from plants to make things work, like gasoline.  4. Think of different places in the world, like a desert or a jungle, where different plants grow.  5. It's a story not about a place, but about a person and all the things they did.",
        "sectioneli5-30-1": "Words have common parts called 'compositional elements', such as 'bi-' and 'biblio-'. For example, 'biblioteca' (library) and 'bilingüe' (bilingual) have these parts. This helps to form new words. 'Bi-' means something double or two, and 'biblio-' is related to books. It is important to note these parts to better understand words and their spelling.",
        "sectioneli5-30-2": "Here is a game where you have to match words with pictures. For example, if you see a girl greeting in two languages, the word would be 'bilingual'. A bus full of books is 'bookmobile'. On a bookshelf full of books, you would think of 'library'. A plane with two engines is 'twin-engine'. The plane in the drawing has two propellers, so it is twin-engine. It is fun to see how words and images connect.",
        "sectioneli5-30-3": "In some words, there are pieces that are used to form new words. These pieces are 'bi-' and 'biblio-'. For example, 'biblio' plus 'graphy' makes 'bibliography', and 'bi-' plus 'monthly' makes 'bimonthly'. We always write these pieces with 'b', and they help create new meanings by combining them with other parts.",
        "sectioneli5-30-4": "Let's learn about parts of words called 'compositive elements'.  1. **'bi-'** means \"two\" or \"double\". For example, in the word 'bimotor', 'bi-' indicates that there are two engines. 2. **'biblio-'** means \"book\". For example, in 'library', 'biblio-' refers to a place with many books. These parts help form new words and are always written with the letter 'b'.",
        "sectioneli5-31-0": "Forests are super important for the planet. First, they do something called photosynthesis, which is like cooking their own food using sunlight, and at the same time, they give us fresh air to breathe. Moreover, forests are the home or \"habitat\" of many animals, like deer and birds. They also help prevent the soil from getting worn out or \"eroded\". That is, the roots of the trees keep the soil in place and prevent it from being carried away by wind or water. When it rains, forests act like large sponges that absorb water and redistribute it, ensuring that there is not too much water running all at once. Finally, forests store water, which helps during dry times when it doesn't rain much. All of this shows why forests are so crucial for keeping the Earth happy and healthy.",
        "sectioneli5-31-1": "Forests are like large natural houses for many plants and animals. They also do something magical called photosynthesis. Imagine that trees have 'superpowers' that they use sunlight to convert air into energy and, while doing so, they release oxygen into the air. This oxygen is what we all need to breathe.",
        "sectioneli5-31-2": "Forests act like a big hug for the earth. Without trees, rain and wind can wash away the soil, dragging it into rivers and streams. This can cause floods and landslides. But trees and plants, with their roots, hold the soil firmly in place so it doesn't get carried away. It's as if the roots were strong hands that keep the soil in place, preventing big problems and helping the soil to be safe and stable.",
        "sectioneli5-31-3": "In forests, the tree canopies act like umbrellas for the rain. They catch the water and let it fall slowly through their branches and leaves. This helps to ensure that the soil underneath doesn't get too wet too quickly, so it doesn't take the soil with it or cause floods. In this way, forests protect the soil and prevent big problems with water.",
        "sectioneli5-31-4": "Forests are like a large sponge. They capture water from fog and rain using the leaves of the trees. Then, the water moves through the roots and soil, storing it. In this way, forests can keep the soil moist even when it doesn't rain much. This is very important so that plants and animals can live well, even in times of drought.",
        "sectioneli5-32-0": "Before writing a summary, you need to understand the text well. First, re-read the article about the functions of forests. You have to see how each part of the text connects with important words in a list, such as photosynthesis or habitat. You have to write the paragraph number that goes with each word and fill out a table to show these relationships. This will help you understand and summarize the text better.",
        "sectioneli5-32-1": "Here we are learning about what forests do. Each important word, like 'photosynthesis' or 'water storage', tells us a task that forests do to help the Earth. For example, the tree canopies help to take care of the soil because they catch and spread the rain. This is important to understand how forests protect and sustain the environment.",
        "sectioneli5-33-0": "Imagine that forests are like great friends of nature. First, the wind and rain cannot remove so much soil because the roots of the trees keep it in place, as if they were hugging it tightly. Also, many animals can live happily because the forest is their home. Furthermore, trees help us breathe better because they produce oxygen, which is what we need to breathe. Therefore, forests are very important because they do all this for us and the animals.",

This dirty air, called smog, makes us sick and makes it hotter. Also, the noise from traffic bothers us. Additionally, there are many cars and sometimes they get stuck, causing traffic jams. Lastly, a lot of water, food, and energy is used, and a lot of garbage is produced that needs to be collected and cleaned. This can be complicated because cleaning systems are not always sufficient.",

They provide protection from the sun and rain, and capture harmful things from the air, like dust and smoke. They also help increase the value of houses and block the wind. Trees clean the air, providing pure oxygen and are a home for animals. Additionally, they make the streets more beautiful, reduce noise, and lower the temperature. That's why trees make life better and more pleasant!",
        "sectioneli5-36-1": "Planting trees in the city is very good for several reasons. Trees help make the air cleaner and the place cooler, which means it can be less hot. They also protect from the sun and rain and provide a home for many animals. Additionally, having trees makes the neighborhood look nicer and can increase the value of houses. Therefore, trees are not only beautiful but also very useful for solving problems like heat and pollution.",
        "sectioneli5-37-0": "The activity asks you to write about how trees can help solve problems in cities, such as pollution. Cities grow and that is good because more people can go to school, get jobs, and take care of their health. But it also brings problems like dirty air. Trees can help clean the air, so they are important for having a better and healthier city.",
